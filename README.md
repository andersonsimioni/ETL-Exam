# ETL-Exam
A repository to deploy the final exam of Python Project for Data Engineering throught Coursera online courses platform.

I used python and jupyter notebook to create simple ETL process to extract bank and exchange rates data
from CSV and JSON files, then transform bank 'Market Cap (USD$ Billion)' information to 'Market Cap (GBP$ Billion)' rate.
Finally, I load the transformed data intoa CSV file on my computer named as 'bank_market_cap_gbp.csv' and removing the index.
